 ## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement 

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
 <br />

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:
 
 * ### **```sales```**
 
The sales table captures all ```customer_id``` level purchases with an corresponding ```order_date``` and ```product_id``` information for when and what menu items were ordered.
 
|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|B          |2021-01-01|2         |
|B          |2021-01-02|2         |
|B          |2021-01-04|1         |
|B          |2021-01-11|1         |
|B          |2021-01-16|3         |
|B          |2021-02-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-07|3         |
 <br /> 

* ### **```menu```**
The menu table maps the ```product_id``` to the actual ```product_name``` and ```price``` of each menu item.

|product_id |product_name|price     |
|-----------|------------|----------|
|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |
 <br /> 

* ### **```members```**
The final members table captures the ```join_date``` when a ```customer_id``` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.
 
|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |

 <br /> 
 
 ## üìã Case Study Questions
<p align="center">
 
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
 <br /> 
 
 ## üîë Solutions
### **Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```Query
 
 select s.customer_id,sum(m.price)as total_amount_spent
 from sales s
 join menu m on

## Bonus Questions
	
### **Q11. Join All The Things. The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.**

**Recreate the following table output using the available data:**


| customer_id | order_date       | product_name | price | member |
| ----------- | -----------------| ------------ | ----- | ------ |
| A           | 2021-01-01       | sushi        | 10    | N      |
| A           | 2021-01-01       | curry        | 15    | N      |
| A           | 2021-01-07       | curry        | 15    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-10       | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-11       | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A           | 2021-01-11       | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-01-01       | curry        | 15    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-02       | curry        | 15    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-04       | sushi        | 10    | N      |
| B           | 2021-01-11       | sushi        | 10    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-01-16       | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| B           | 2021-02-01       | ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| C           | 2021-01-01       | ramen        | 12    | N      |

| C           | 2021-01-07       | ramen        | 12    | N      |
	
```Query
select s.customer_id,order_date,product_name,price,
 CASE WHEN order_date>=join_date THEN 'Y'
      WHEN order_date < join_date THEN 'N' 
      ELSE 'N' END as members
 from sales s
 join menu m
 on s.product_id=m.product_id
 left join members me
 on s.customer_id=me.customer_id
 order by customer_id,order_date;
```

### **Q12. Rank All The Things. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

**Recreate the following table output using the available data:**

| customer_id | order_date       | product_name | price | member | ranking |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| A           | 2021-01-01       | sushi        | 10    | N      |         |

| A           | 2021-01-10       | ramen        | 12    | Y      | 2       |

| C           | 2021-01-01       | ramen        | 12    | N      |         |
