## üîë Solutions
### **Q1. How many pizzas were ordered?**
```Query
select COUNT(order_id)as no_of_Pizza_ordered
from #updated_customer_orders;
```
 **Result:**
  
|no_of_Pizza_ordered|
|-------------------|
|     14            | 
  
total **14 pizzas** were ordered

### **Q2. How many unique customer orders were made?**
 ```Query 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id))as unique_orders
from #updated_customer_orders;
```
**Result:**
|unique_orders|
|-------------|
|10           |
 
**10 UNIQUE customer orders** 

### **Q3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

```Query
SELECT runner_id,COUNT(order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM #updated_runner_orders
WHERE distance <> 0
group by runner_id
order by runner_id;
```
**Result:**
| runner_id | successful_orders |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

### **Q4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```Query
select pizza_name,COUNT(c.pizza_id)as no_of_pizza_delivered
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
join pizza_names pn
on c.pizza_id= pn.pizza_id
where distance<> 0
group by pizza_name;
```
**Result:**
| pizza_name | no_of_pizza_delivered |
|------------|-----------------------|
| Meatlovers | 9                     |
| Vegetarian | 3                     |

 **9 ```Meatlovers```** pizzas were ordered.
 **3 ```Vegetarian```** pizzas were ordered.

### **Q5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```Query
select c.customer_id,pizza_name,COUNT(order_id)as no_of_pizza_ordered
from #updated_customer_orders c
join pizza_names p
on c.pizza_id=p.pizza_id
group by customer_id,pizza_name
order by customer_id;
```
--other way 
```QUERY
select customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)as meatlover,
SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)as Vegetarian
from #updated_customer_orders 
group by customer_id; 
```
**Result:**
| customer_id | meat_lovers | vegetarian |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 101         | 2           | 1          |
| 103         | 3           | 1          |
| 104         | 3           | 0          |
| 105         | 0           | 1          |
| 102         | 2           | 1          |

- **Customer 101:** **2 meatlovers** and **1 vegetarian**.
- **Customer 102:** **2 meatlovers** and **1 vegetarian**.
- **Customer 103:** **3 meatlovers** and **1 vegetarian**.
- **Customer 104:** **3 meatlovers**.
- **Customer 105:** **1 vegetarian**.

### **Q6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```Query  
with CTE
as
(
  select c.order_id,count(pizza_id)as count_of_pizza
  from #updated_customer_orders c
  join #updated_runner_orders r
  on c.order_id = r.order_id 
  where distance <> 0
  group by c.order_id
)
select MAX(count_of_pizza)as max_pizza_in_single_order
from CTE; 
```
**Result:**
| max_Pizza_in_single_order|
|--------------------------|
|        3                 |  

maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order is **3**
  
### **Q7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```Query
select c.customer_id ,
       sum(CASE
               WHEN exclusions IS not null or extras is not null then 1
               ELSE 0
               END)as change,
       sum(CASE
               WHEN exclusions IS null or extras IS null then 1
               ELSE 0
               END)as no_change
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance <> 0
group by c.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```
**Result:**
| customer_id | changes | no_change |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 101         | 2       | 0         |
| 102         | 3       | 0         |
| 103         | 3       | 0         |
| 104         | 3       | 0         |
| 105         | 1       | 0         | 

### **Q8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**
```Query

select c.order_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions is not null and extras is not null THEN 1
    ELSE 0 END)as pizza_with_exclusion_and_extras
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance <> 0
and exclusions <> ''
and extras <> ''
group by c.order_id;
```
**Result:**
|Order_id| pizza_with_exclusion_and_extras| 
|--------|--------------------------------|
| 10     |        1                       |
