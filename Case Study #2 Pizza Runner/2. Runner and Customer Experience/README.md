 ## üìã Case Study's Questions
  
1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
  
2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

## üöÄ Solutions

### **Q1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)**
```Query
with CTE
as
(
select runner_id,
CASE
     WHEN registration_date between '2021-01-01' and '2021-01-07' THEN 'week 1'
     WHEN registration_date between '2021-01-08' and '2021-01-14' THEN 'week 2'
     ELSE 'week 3'
     END as [week]
from runners
group by runner_id,registration_date
)
select [week],count(runner_id) as Runner_sign_up
from CTE
group by [week];
```
**Result:** 
  
| Week   | Runner_sign_up |
|--------|----------------|
| Week 1 | 2              |
| Week 2 | 1              |
| Week 3 | 1              |  

 ### **Q2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
```Query
with CTE
as
(
select c.order_id,runner_id,DATEDIFF(MINUTE,order_time,pickup_time)as time_taken
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance <> 0
group by c.order_id,runner_id,order_time,pickup_time
)
select runner_id ,AVG(time_taken)as average_mins_taken_to_arrive_HQ
from CTE
group by runner_id;
```
**Result:**
| runner_id | average_mins_taken_to_arrive_HQ |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 1         |    14                           |
| 2         |    20                           |
| 3         |    10                           |

 ### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
 ```Query
with prepare_time
as
( 
select c.order_id,COUNT(c.order_id)as Pizza_count,
DATEDIFF(MINUTE,order_time,pickup_time)as Pizza_preparation_time
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance<> 0
group by c.order_id,order_time,pickup_time
)
select pizza_count,AVG(Pizza_preparation_time)as avg_time_to_preapre
from prepare_time
group by Pizza_count;
```
**Result:**

| pizzas_order_count | avg_time_to _prepare|
|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1                  | 12                  |
| 2                  | 18                  |
| 3                  | 30                  |

### **Q4. What was the average distance travelled for each runner?**
```Query
select distinct customer_id,round(AVG(distance),2)as Average_distance
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance <> 0
group by customer_id
order by customer_id;
```
**Result:**

| Customer_id | Average_distance  |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 101       | 20                  |
| 102       | 16.73               |
| 103       | 23.4                |
| 104       | 10                  |
| 105       | 25                  |
 
### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```Query
with time_taken
as
(
select c.order_id,runner_id,DATEDIFF(MINUTE,order_time,pickup_time)as delivery_time
from #updated_customer_orders c
join #updated_runner_orders r
on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance <> 0
group by c.order_id,runner_id,order_time,pickup_time
)
select (MAX(delivery_time)-MIN(delivery_time))as diff_longest_shortest_delivery_time
from time_taken;
```
**Result**
|diff_longest_shortest_delivery_time|
|-----------------------------------|
| 20                                |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```Query
select c.order_id, runner_id,count(c.order_id)as pizza_count,(distance*1000)as distance_meter,
(duration*60)as time_sec,round((distance)/(duration)*60,2)as avg_speed
from #updated_customer_orders c
 join #updated_runner_orders r
 on c.order_id=r.order_id
 where distance <> 0
 group by runner_id,duration,distance,c.order_id
 order by avg_speed desc;
 ```
 **Result**

| order_id | runner_id | pizzas_count | distance_meter | time_sec | speed |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| 8        | 2         | 1            | 23.4           | 15       | 93.60 |
| 7        | 2         | 1            | 25             | 25       | 60.00 |
| 10       | 1         | 2            | 10             | 10       | 60.00 |
| 2        | 1         | 1            | 20             | 27       | 44.44 |
| 3        | 1         | 2            | 13.4           | 20       | 40.20 |
| 5        | 3         | 1            | 10             | 15       | 40.00 |
| 1        | 1         | 1            | 20             | 32       | 37.50 |
| 4        | 2         | 3            | 23.4           | 40       | 35.10 |

### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
 ```Query
 With CTE 
as
(
select runner_id,count(order_id)as total_delivery,
SUM(CASE
    WHEN distance <> 0 THEN 1 
    ELSE distance
    END) as successful_delivery,
SUM(CASE
    WHEN cancellation like '%cancel%' THEN 1
    ELSE cancellation
    END) as failed_delivery
from #updated_runner_orders 
 group by runner_id
)
select runner_id,(SUM(successful_delivery)/SUM(total_delivery)*100)as delivery_percent
from CTE
group by runner_id;
```
**Result:**

| runner_id | delivery_percent|
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1         | 100             |
| 2         | 75              |
| 3         | 50              |
